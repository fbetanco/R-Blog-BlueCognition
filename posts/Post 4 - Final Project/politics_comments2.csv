I did fieldwork for many years in Cambodia before turning to more recently to do research on the United States. AMA!","Im Alex Hinton, a professor and Director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University. With a long-time focus on mass atrocity and its resolution in Cambodia and other parts of the world, my research is looking all too relevant to the U.S. with the extreme polarization and rising threat of democratic backsliding, extremism, and even violence with the resurgence of former President Trump. 

As an [anthropologist who studies peace and conflict](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/alex-hinton), I recently went to the annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), to better understand the [Make America Great Again](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/22/maga-republicans-analysis) faithful  and their diehard support for Trump, and wrote about it for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/i-went-to-cpac-as-an-anthropologist-to-understand-trumps-base-they-believe-more-than-ever-he-is-a-savior-224205), [an independent nonprofit news organization that gets experts like me to write for the public](https://theconversation.com). 

Im taking over their reddit for this AMA.

Im also the author and editor of seventeen books, including two of my most recent: [*It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the US* (NYU, 2021)](https://nyupress.org/9781479808014/it-can-happen-here/) and [*Perpetrators: Encountering Humanity's Dark Side* (Stanford, 2023)](http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=34348).

Feel free to ask me anything about human rights, depolarization, genocide debates about Israel and Hamas or Russia and Ukraine (I wrote other Conversation articles on these topics), the Cambodian genocide and the countrys search for justice, or MAGA and my key takeaways from attending CPAC last month. 

*Thoughts and opinions are my own. 

**That's a wrap:** Thank you all for your thoughtful and great questions! I'm sorry that I wasn't able to respond to all of them but appreciate the engagement. -- Alex Hinton
